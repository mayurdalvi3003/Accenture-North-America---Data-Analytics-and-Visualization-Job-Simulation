# Accenture North America Data Analytics and Visualization Internship

Welcome to my repository for the projects completed during the Accenture North America Data Analytics and Visualization Job Simulation. 
This virtual internship allowed me to gain hands-on experience in handling real-world data, transforming it through cleaning and 
modeling techniques, and turning data into actionable insights through visualization and storytelling.

## Overview

This internship comprised several key tasks that mimic the role of a Data Analyst working on actual client projects at Accenture. 
Each task focused on different aspects of Data Analytics and Visualization, including:

- **Project Understanding**: Learning to define and understand project objectives and requirements.
- **Data Cleaning & Modeling**: Applying various data preprocessing and modeling techniques to prepare data for analysis.
- **Data Visualization & Storytelling**: Creating visual representations of data to uncover patterns, trends, and insights.
- **Presenting to the Client**: Developing the skills necessary to effectively communicate findings to stakeholders.

## Technologies Used

- Python (Pandas  , NumPy , Matplotlib , Seaborn )
- Power BI
- Jupyter Notebook

## Projects

Below is a list of projects/tasks completed during the internship:

### 1. Project Title: [Analysis Of Social Buzz Clients Dataset to find the top-5 Categories on the basis of Popularity Score]
**Objective**:  An analysis of Social Buzz's content categories that highlights the top 5 categories with the 
largest aggregate popularity
**Approach**: To solve this , i used Python Pandas , NumPy , Matplotlib and Seaborn Libraries .
**Results**:I have given .pbix file that is PowerBI dashboard file , you can go through it to see the final output.
**Visualizations**: Included screenshots in the above repository or you can see Powetpoint slides to see the visualizations or you can 
use `Main.ipynb` file to see the entire procedure to reach at the final output

## Learning Outcomes

Through this internship, I have:
* Completed a simulation focused on advising a hypothetical social media client
   as a Data Analyst at Accenture
* Cleaned, modelled and analyzed 7 datasets to uncover insights into content
   trends to inform strategic decisions
* Prepared a PowerPoint deck and video presentation to communicate key insights
   for the client and internal stakeholders
